# Genomic_DoBox
Using the power of Chameleon Cloud, this application probes an OpenStack Swift Container for DNA sequenced data and then processes it into a human-friendly format. The DNA processing is done by using primarily Linux-based Command Line Tools in a specific order - commonly called "pipelines". For the sake of privacy, the current processing pipelines are not being released on Github quite yet. For clarities sake, a generic pipeline is included in the JSON folder.
